## What is this?
This is a [Hanami web framework](http://hanamirb.org) tutorial gone through by me.

## Why are you playing around with this framework?
I never feel getting better at 'using' Rails increases my confidence about Ruby (or general OOP practices).
Now, Hanami web framework looks way more 'true' to plain Ruby objects, and I believe that leads me to be a better programmer.
